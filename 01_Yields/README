The procedure for the yields calculation is as as follows.

- Set your environment variable CRANEDIR to your CRANE directory
- Then check the input.txt file in your CRANE directory.
- Run 01_gen_runs.py, this will produce all the command line inputs necessary to create the look-up table. 
- Executing the CRPropa runs is up the user. I have included pbs scripts for emabrassingly parallel runs. 
- Once the CRPropa runs are complete, execute 02_gen_LUT.py to produce the lookup table. 
- Now you have the yields look-up tables needed to model the fluence of UHECRs and Neutrinos.
