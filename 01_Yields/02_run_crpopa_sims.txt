The collection of CRPropa runs is a rather massive set of embarassingly parallel runs.
The command line outputs are provided by running them will depend on the architecture available to the user.
I have left this step open since it is not necessarily practical to use the python-based parallel processing tools.

I have used the pbs scripts provided. 
I run 

qsub pbs_run_Z_1.sh
qsub pbs_run_Z_2.sh
qsub pbs_run_Z_7.sh
qsub pbs_run_Z_14.sh
qsub pbs_run_Z_26.sh

The Z=26 runs can be troublesome as the output text files are rather large.
I have found they have to be run twice in some cases or they exceed the
memory available to the genfromtxt function in numpy.

Do check for errors in these runs!
